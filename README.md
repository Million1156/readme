### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=nat2k15&label=Views&color=blue&style=plastic)


I'm a college student @ Stanford planning to pursue datacenter engineering when I'm older. Currently, I work @Apple as a Software Engineer on the iOS platform. I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and coding assigments. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems ‚ú®. Apart from that I also love to party with friends and hang out in Discord calls and make discord bots. I'm currently into Server Development (eg. FiveM/Datacenter) üï∏Ô∏è and working on my journey on becoming a datacenter engineer. If I had to choose,JavaScript or Lua ftw!
