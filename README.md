### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=torvalds&label=Views&color=blue&style=plastic)


I'm a developer with Amazon planning to pursue datacenter engineering when I'm more experienced. I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and coding assigments. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems ‚ú®. Apart from that I also love to party with friends and hang out in Discord calls and make discord bots. I'm currently into software engineering (eg. "git" is software, therefore people like me made it.) üï∏Ô∏è and working on my journey on becoming a datacenter engineer. If I had to choose,JavaScript or Lua ftw!
